//TDD Step 1: Write test code
//End of step 1 error observed as expected : error: ‘DetectContinuousRanges’ was not declared in this scope

//TDD Step2 : Just added function to make code compile
  //end of step2 as expected test failed since actual code implementation not yet done : Assertion `DetectContinuousRanges(currentsamplesarray) == 2' failed

 //TDD Step3:Code Implementation done to make the test pass
//as expected at end of step3 test case got passed

//TDD Step4:New functions added to refactor code and to reduce CCN value


Other info :
Maximum count of continuous ranges that can be detected is assumed as 100
If no consecutive range is found then range count is considered as 0
